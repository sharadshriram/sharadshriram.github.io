## Sharad's website
This repository contains the hugo source code that powers my website: [https://sharadshriram.github.io](https://sharadshriram.github.io).

#### Credits
The website uses the [beautifulhugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) as the base theme. The publications page is heavily inspired by [Prof. Cluadia Hauff's publication page](https://chauff.github.io/publications/). The images for the publication categories are borrowed from [chauff.github.io repo](https://github.com/chauff/chauff.github.io).
