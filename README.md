### Website source

This repository contains the hugo source code that powers my website: [https://sharadshriram.github.io](https://sharadshriram.github.io).

#### Credits
The website uses the [beautifulhugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) as the base theme.

The publications page is heavily inspired by [Prof. Cluadia Hauff's publication page](https://chauff.github.io/publications/). The images for the publication categories are borrowed from [chauff.github.io repo](https://github.com/chauff/chauff.github.io).



#### Past theme


The website is built using Hugo with [spf13's Hugo port](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) of the [Hyde Theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

The color and content layout inspirations are from https://knolleary.net/
