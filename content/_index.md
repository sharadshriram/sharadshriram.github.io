## About 
For a brief and compact overview, take a look at my 1-page [CV](../docs/SharadShriram_Resume.pdf).


### The journey so far..

I have received my Masters degree in Computer Science from the [Delft University of Technology, Delft, NL](https://tudelft.nl/en/) and my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, IN](https://amrita.edu/). While pursuing my Bachelors degree, I was introduced to the world of academic research and worked on projects at the intersection of Internet of Things (IoT), Edge computing, and Predictive Analytics. It was when I was purusing my masters at TU Delft that I start specializing on data science and machine learning.


The early days of my career was at the [Centre for Networked Intelligence](https://cni.iisc.ac.in) at the Indian Insitute of Science, Bangalore where I was supervised by [Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/rajesh-sundaresan/) between late-2019 and mid-2021. My contributions were mainly in projects apart of the [centre's COVID-19 response efforts](https://cni.iisc.ac.in/covid-19-response/). As the world started opening up post pandemic, I became a full-time contributor to the [DataCommons](https://datacommons.org), the open knowledge graph project at Google. My contributions were mainly in expanding the data coverage and defining new schema on the knowledge graph. The project resonates with my desire to have a unified data store, where public data is cleaned, and curated for machine consumption. After some time away from active research, I wanted to test the waters again, and joined Google Research India (now Google DeepMind India) as a Pre-Doctoral researcher working on applied ML projects with inclinations towards ML systems and Generative AI. At present, I am working as an AI Privacy Engineer working on the intersection of Machine Learning models and Applied Privacy - along the lines of my [master's thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:30846529-9080-4945-8502-dc962ec00bf3).
