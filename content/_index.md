## About 
For a brief and compact overview, take a look at my 1-page [CV](../docs/Sharad_Shriram_1pgCV.pdf).

I have joined Google Research India as a Pre-Doctoral researcher from July, 2022. During my pre-doc, I will continue to explore human-centric AI solutions for privacy preservation. My pre-doc will be supervised by Gaurav Aggarwal and Ding Wang.

Between mid-2021 and mid-2022, I was a full-time contributor to the [DataCommons](https://datacommons.org), the open knowledge graph project at Google. My contributions were mainly in expanding the data coverage and defining new schema on the knowledge graph. The project resonates with my desire to have a unified data store, where public data is cleaned, and curated for machine consumption.

The early days of my career was at the [Centre for Networked Intelligence](https://cni.iisc.ac.in) at the Indian Insitute of Science, Bangalore where I was supervised by [Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/rajesh-sundaresan/) between late-2019 and mid-2021. My contributions were mainly in projects apart of the [centre's COVID-19 response efforts](https://cni.iisc.ac.in/covid-19-response/). 

I have received my Masters degree in Computer Science from the [Delft University of Technology, Delft, NL](https://tudelft.nl/en/)(2019) and my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, IN](https://amrita.edu/)(2016).


My research interest is to study how humans and AI can work together to solve complex tasks. Privacy preservation in images, the topic of (my [master's thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:30846529-9080-4945-8502-dc962ec00bf3)) is my current focus. I am looking to study the point of deferal (when to ask humans, based on AI's predictions); metrics (beyond standard KPI, what metrics are unique to human-AI teams?); communication (when and how to ask humans? - from a task perspective as well as from a communication/feedback perspective); different interactions (human-AI, human-model and human-robot[agent]).
