###    Hi! Welcome to my digital world.

I am currently working as an internal contributor for [DataCommons](https://datacommons.org), the open knowledge graph project at Google. 

Previously, I worked at the [Centre for Networked Intelligence](https://cni.iisc.ac.in/) with [Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/rajesh-sundaresan/) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. I completed my masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Technology from the [Web Information Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/) group, at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. ir. Alessandro Bozzon](https://www.alessandrobozzon.com/). During my stay in the Netherlands, I spent the summer as an [IBM Extreme Blue](https://www.ibm.com/employment/extremeblue/) intern. My journey started at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (University)](https://amrita.edu) where I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and also was initiated to pursue research by [Dr. V. Ananthanarayanan](https://amrita.edu/faculty/v-ananthanarayanan/) and [Dr. P. Bagavathi Sivakumar](https://amrita.edu/faculty/pbsk/).

My primary research interest is in the theme of "Human-centric intelligence". I am exploring how much humans (represented as the annotators or crowd) and AI (different ML learning approaches and strategies) can work together, "Human-AI" teams. My first exploration on "Human-AI" teams was in my [master's thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:30846529-9080-4945-8502-dc962ec00bf3) where I studied the system design required for "Human-AI" teams to effectively detect and preserve privacy in images used for image annotation tasks. My fascination to understand the "human" stemmed from a course project where we developed a robot assistant to help cognitivelly challenged, single mothers prepare breakfast for their child.

The other topic which has piqued my interest recently, is "fairness", and "explainability" in AI, and I am more interested in studying the perception of these topics by humans (through human computation tasks). Through opportunities to work in different projects at [Centre for Networked Intelligence](https://cni.iisc.ac.in/), I my research interests expanded to Natural Language Processing, Large-scale data processing, and Data-driven Modelling. It was while working on these projects that I wanted to make public data easily accessible for machine consumption which led me to work on the [DataCommons project](https://datacommons.org).
