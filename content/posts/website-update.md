Happy new year, 2022!

Three months into the switch to Hugo, today I was able to add more content about work I have done in the past and improve the access to information aspect of the site. Whilst, the site still needs more content to improve the UX, this is a good start for the new year. The biggest change on the website is on the automation through github actions, whooo! this was a nice update :D 

The summary of changes done in this update are the following:
- move the blog archive out of the homepage
- the homepage serves as the about page
- add a page for projects
- check navigation of the blog archive after moving it from the home page
- website maintenance and refresh automated through Github actions :yaay:!

I am still contemplating on the content to add to this blog, till then I shall try adding more posts as I build the website.

Till next time...
