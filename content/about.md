I am currently working as an internal contributor to the [DataCommons project](https://datacommons.org). 

Previously, I worked at the [Centre for Networked Intelligence](https://cni.iisc.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. I completed my masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Technology from the [Web Information Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/) group, at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. ir. Alessandro Bozzon](https://www.alessandrobozzon.com/). During my stay in the Netherlands, I spent the Summer of 2018 as an [IBM Extreme Blue](https://www.ibm.com/employment/extremeblue/) intern.
